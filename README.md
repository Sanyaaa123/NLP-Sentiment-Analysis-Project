In todayâ€™s digital age, customer feedback plays a crucial role in shaping business strategies and improving products or services. However, manually analyzing thousands of customer reviews is time-consuming and impractical. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the process of sentiment analysis, enabling businesses to quickly understand customer opinions.

The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify customer reviews as either liked (positive sentiment) or disliked (negative sentiment). By using techniques such as text preprocessing, tokenization, vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF or embeddings), and training models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Neural Networks, the system can accurately identify the underlying sentiment in textual feedback.

This sentiment classification system can be integrated into platforms to provide real-time insights, support customer satisfaction analysis, and inform strategic decisions.
